        Crochet is a craft that allows you to create textiles through the use of
        a single hook and some yarn. Although often confused for knitting,
        crochet has unique stitches that produce lively motifs and designs. Some
        advantages of crochet are that it is more beginner friendly than
        knitting, as it is harder to unravel projects accidentally. Along with
        this, stitches do not need to be passed back and forth between needles
        like they do in knitting. If this sounds unfamiliar or confusing, don't
        worry! Simply click the button below to learn how to begin your first
        crochet project.
