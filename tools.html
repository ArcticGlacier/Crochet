        <h2 class = "toolSubHeader">HOOK SIZES</h2>
        <p>Crochet hooks are used to manipulate the yarn into stitches. They come in many different sizes and are measured by the diameter of the shaft. You can find the size engraved in milimetres on the handle. For beginners, it can be overwhelming to know which hook to use for a certain project. A general guide is listed below: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Smaller hooks are used for projects where the stitches must be densely packed together. Super small hooks ranging from 0.6mm to 2mm can be used for lacemaking, crocheted jewelry, etc.</li><br>
          <li>Medium hooks are usually used for projects that you will wear. Hooks ranging from 2.0mm to 8mm can be used for Beanies, cardigans, scarves, baby blankets etc.</li><br>
          <li>Jumbo hooks are best used for large scale projects such as blankets. These hooks usually range from 12mm-25mm</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h2 class = "toolSubHeader">YARN WEIGHTS</h2>
        <p>There are many kinds of yarn available, each ranging in price. Synthetic yarns such as acrylic yarn are much more affordable compared to something like wool. Choosing the type of yarn as well as yarn weight is something to keep in mind when first starting off a project.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fingering weight refers to thin yarn and can be used for socks, baby clothes, and scarves. Smaller or lower range of medium hooks would go well with these.</li><br>
          <li>Worsted weight refers to a yarn of medium thickness, and are super versatile as they can be used for any project. Medium hooks pair well with this type of yarn.</li><br>
          <li>Bulky weight refers to yarn that is very chunky and thick. It goes well with certain sweaters and blankets by using jumbo hooks.</li><br>
        </ul>
